# Automated Passenger Board Kiosk

## Overview

This project is for the AI Engineer with Microsoft Azure nanodegree program. It consists on creating an automated passenger board kiosk that validates a person's identification, boarding pass data, extract insights from videos (sentiments and emotions), etc. To get started with the project, it required preparing materials such as boarding passes, and id documents. The [original starter project](https://github.com/udacity/cd0461-building-computer-vision-solutions-with-azure-project-starter) has all the information needed to start development.

## Config

I am using a config based approach, so, once you have created your Azure services (`FormRecognizer`, `FaceAPI`, `CustomVision`) in your Azure Directory, update the `config.template.yaml` file and then rename it as `config.yaml`.

For security purposes, I am not sharing my credentials, even though they are free tier ðŸ¤‘.
